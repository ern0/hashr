Packet metaformat
=================

Gross packet lenght must be shorter than receive buffer size.

Specific packets have strict rules for the number and order
of blocks.

Packet
------
- 4 byte prefix: "HSHr"
- followed by blocks (see below)
- last block is only a special header without data

Block
-----
- 4 byte identifier (e.g. "CMND" for command)
- 4 byte length
- payload

The first block ID is also determines the type of the packet.

When the block ID is "ENDm", it marks the end of the series
of blocks. Possible further bytes in the packet are ignored.

Byte order
----------
Hi-first, like ARM or MC68000 native.
