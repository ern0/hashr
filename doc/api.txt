Overview
========
Hash map daemon:
- Key-value database
- In-memory storage
- TCP/IP interface
- Functionality
  + CRUD 
  + info, incl. item count
  + search (full-text k/v/k+v, no index)
  + reorganize (hash method, hash capacity)


TCP/IP
======
TCP/IP actions:
- connect
- command -> response
- disconnect


Protocol
========
Protocol format should be binary or JSON. The server always
reports a status code, other fields are command-specific or
result-specific.
