Hash methods
============

Hash methods can set by "reorg" command.

Example:

  hashr-1> reorg 10

Reorganize the hashtable, using "elf" 
hashing method.

The hash method can be a number between 0 and 10:

Methods for debugging
--------------------- 
 0: "debug0"
 1: "debug1"

These methods use the first or second character
of the key as hash value, respectively. The value
will be in range of 0..255.

These methods are not designed for real life,
but useful for debugging: the test program can
define, which slot will be used to store the item.

Further implemented methods
---------------------------
 2: "additive"
 3: "xor"
 4: "rotating"
 5: "Bernstein"
 6: "modified Berstein"
 7: "shift-add-xor"
 8: "Fowler-Noll-Vo"
 9: "one-at-a-time"
10: "elf"
